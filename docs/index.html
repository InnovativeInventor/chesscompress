    <p>ChessCompress is a custom chess compression algorithm that uses a chess engine combined with a neural network to achieve near state of the art compression results.</p>
    <h2 id="pgn-chess-format">PGN Chess Format</h2>
    <p>For simplicity, I'm adding an example of a PGN-encoded chess game that'll make reading the rest of the page easier. I've dropped the headers for simplicity.</p>

    <p>You can see how each move affects the state of the board by looking at this chess game: <a href="https://lichess.org/mzewWRQh/black">https://lichess.org/mzewWRQh/black</a>.</p>
    <h2 id="current-state-of-the-art">Current State of the Art</h2>
    <p>The <a href="https://lichess.org/blog/Wqa7GiAAAOIpBLoY/developer-update-275-improved-game-compression">current state of the art</a> claims to achieve 4.4 bits/move of compression over the entire Lichess dataset. For some context, here are the other methods' efficacy.</p>
    <p><img src="https://images.prismic.io/lichess/c12199b895bcae9bccc1812d41c56aecfeb95f1c_huffman-result.png?auto=compress,format" alt="image" /></p>
    <p><em>Source: <a href="https://lichess.org/blog/Wqa7GiAAAOIpBLoY/developer-update-275-improved-game-compression">https://lichess.org/blog/Wqa7GiAAAOIpBLoY/developer-update-275-improved-game-compression</a></em></p>
    <p>They achieve this by using huffman codes and a quick set of ordering rules that attempt to rank each move by likeliness of being played.</p>
    <p>Note: I have been unable to reproduce the results that the current state of the art got. Additionally, the state of the art statistics were trained on the dataset it was validated on – this is not good practice.</p>
    <h2 id="huffman-codes">Huffman Codes</h2>
    <p>Huffman codes are a very common compression technique. The general idea is to assign lower length bitstrings to the most frequent characters or string of characters.</p>
    <p>For example, let's say that we're encoding the first move in chess. Here is a rough estimate of the frequency distribution of the first move.</p>
    <table>
    <thead>
    <tr class="header">
    <th>Move</th>
    <th>Prob.</th>
    <th>Bitstring</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr class="odd">
    <td>e4</td>
    <td>.33</td>
    <td>0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="even">
    <td>d4</td>
    <td>.22</td>
    <td>10</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="odd">
    <td>c4</td>
    <td>.11</td>
    <td>110</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="even">
    <td>f4</td>
    <td>.05</td>
    <td>111</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="odd">
    <td>...</td>
    <td>...</td>
    <td>...</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>As you can see, the bitstring gets longer and longer the more unlikely a particular move is. In this case, it would take only 1 bit to encode the most common move, e4.</p>
    <p>The problem with this is that there is no difference between e4 having a probability of .33 or .23. This leads to inefficiencies when encoding since if the first few moves all have similar probabilities, there is no way to account for that in the encoding.</p>
    <h2 id="adaptive-arithmetic-coding">Adaptive Arithmetic Coding</h2>
    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_coding">Adaptive Arithmetic codes</a> are a more rare compression technique which I used to squeeze out some more performance from my prediction stats. Essentially, after determining the probability distribution of the next move, you generate a table like this</p>
    <p>Move 1:</p>
    <table>
    <thead>
    <tr class="header">
    <th>Move</th>
    <th>Prob.</th>
    <th>Space Allocated</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr class="odd">
    <td>e4</td>
    <td>.33</td>
    <td>.33</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="even">
    <td>d4</td>
    <td>.22</td>
    <td>.33-.55</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="odd">
    <td>c4</td>
    <td>.11</td>
    <td>.55-.66</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="even">
    <td>f4</td>
    <td>.05</td>
    <td>.66-.71</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="odd">
    <td>...</td>
    <td>...</td>
    <td>...</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>Then, suppose white moves e4 - the next distribution table will look something like this:</p>
    <table>
    <thead>
    <tr class="header">
    <th>Move</th>
    <th>Prob.</th>
    <th>Space Allocated</th>
    <th>Game Encoding</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr class="odd">
    <td>e5</td>
    <td>.33</td>
    <td>.33</td>
    <td>0 - 0.11</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="even">
    <td>d5</td>
    <td>.22</td>
    <td>.33-.55</td>
    <td>0.11 - 0.1826</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="odd">
    <td>...</td>
    <td>...</td>
    <td>...</td>
    <td>...</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>Let's suppose that black's response is e5. This means that we can encode our sequence of moves as some number between 0 and 0.11, the rough probability of the first move multiplied by the second move. This would continue until the game is over and we have a very specific decimal range in the range between 0 and 1. A number within this range can be very efficiently encoded in binary by finding a fraction in the range with a power of 2 in the denominator.</p>
    <p>A visual example from Wikipedia encoding "WIKI" can be helpful:</p>
    <p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/81/Arithmetic_coding_visualisation_circle.svg/1024px-Arithmetic_coding_visualisation_circle.svg.png" alt="image" /></p>
    <p>This method reduces the inefficiencies in huffman codes and is what I implemented. This provides context – if there are multiple equally likely moves, this is reflected in the encoding.</p>
    <h2 id="methodology">Methodology</h2>
    <p>So, beating the state of the art now appears fairly simple. Simply moving towards an adaptive arithmetic coding scheme should, in theory, result in compression gains. The only problem that needed to be solved was generating an accurate probability distribution.</p>
    <p>A UCI (Universal Chess Interface) compliant chess engine reports on the strength of a position by denoting it in centipawn values. A centipawn is 1/100th of a pawn's worth. Intially, I tried to graph the centipawn distribution of the moves that everybody took and tried to estimate probabilities from there. However, over a large enough sample size, people's performances were about average, which made this approach not useful. A simple naive ordering using Stockfish, one of the best chess engines, gave me approximately 5.0 bits/move.</p>
    <p><img src="taken.png" alt="image" /></p>
    <p><img src="ignored.png" alt="image" /></p>
    <p>There is a negligible difference between these two graphs.</p>
    <p>This is something now that can be turned in to a classification problem. If fed into a properly trained neural network, the neural network can smartly determine the probability distribution of each move. Even better, this takes very little modification to a normal classification network.</p>
    <p>After trying to use my mac to do thousands of iterations on the chess data, I opted to do some preprocessing on my mac and do most of the compute-intensive tasks on Google Colab. The custom collab notebook used to train the network is here:</p>
    <p><a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1-0tk8ETe9Zuj3LIGa3hy6Fgq8uqhU50z">https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1-0tk8ETe9Zuj3LIGa3hy6Fgq8uqhU50z</a></p>
    <p>The structure of the optimized neural network is as follows:</p>
    <pre><code>model = keras.Sequential([
        keras.layers.Dense(65, activation=&#39;relu&#39;),
        # keras.layers.Dense(64, activation=&#39;tanh&#39;),
        keras.layers.Dropout(0.5),
        keras.layers.Dense(64//2),
        keras.layers.Dense(65)
    ])
    </code></pre>
    <p>The model does look slightly overfit on an approx. 18000 training data input size, which was partly fixed by adding a dropout. Using this neural network, the compression results significantly improved to approximately 4.6 bits/move.</p>
    <h2 id="challenges">Challenges</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>gathering enough data quickly (processing with stockfish and using <code>python-chess</code> was extremely slow – I had to make some modifications to the library to speed things up)</li>
    <li>prevent the neural network from overfitting</li>
    <li>figuring out how to optimize and do a parameter search (by hand)</li>
    </ul>
